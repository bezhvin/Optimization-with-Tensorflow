# Optimization-with-Tensorflow
Using tensorflow's interfaces to do your own optimization

There are number of jupyter notebook you may open in google colab and try to learn how to use tensorflow interfaces for optimization:

1- [Simple optimization example without constraints](https://github.com/bezhvin/Optimization-with-Tensorflow/blob/main/SimpleExampleNoConstraint.ipynb): This might be boring for you if you are experienced with tensorflow and optimization. But it is a great start for those who want to learn from scratch.
