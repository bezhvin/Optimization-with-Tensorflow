# Optimization-with-Tensorflow
Using tensorflow's interfaces to do your own optimization

There are number of jupyter notebook you may open in google colab and try to learn how to use tensorflow interfaces for optimization:

1- [Simple optimization example](https://github.com/bezhvin/Optimization-with-Tensorflow/blob/main/SimpleExampleNoConstraint.ipynb): This might be boring for you if you are experienced with tensorflow and optimization. But it is a great start for those who want to learn from scratch. Specially if you are interested to know how to customize your optimization with some cosntraints.
